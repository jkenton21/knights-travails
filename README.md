# knights-travails

The purpose of this project is to use javascript algorithms and data structures to apply to a chess scenario.

The idea is to enter a starting and ending coordinate on a chessboard.

Then the algorithm will figure out the shortest possible path that it would take a knight to get to the desired end coordinate.

The knight's path is two squares in one direction then one square in the next direction.

On a two dimensional chess board the coordinates for the knight's possible moves are as follows: (2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2).
